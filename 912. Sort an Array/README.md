# 912. Sort an Array

## Medium

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it. You must solve the problem without
using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

### Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
`-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104`
