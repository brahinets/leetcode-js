# 206. Reverse Linked List

## Easy

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.  
`-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
