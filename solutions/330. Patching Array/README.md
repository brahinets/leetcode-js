# 330. Patching Array

## Hard

Given a sorted integer array `nums` and an integer `n`, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the
range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches
required.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
