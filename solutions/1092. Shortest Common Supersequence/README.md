# 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence

## Hard

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If
there are multiple valid strings, return any of them. A string `s` is a subsequence of string `t` if deleting some
number of characters from `t` (possibly `0`) results in the string `s`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
- `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.
