# 41. First Missing Positive

## Hard

Given an unsorted integer array `nums`. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in `nums`. You must
implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` auxiliary space.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
