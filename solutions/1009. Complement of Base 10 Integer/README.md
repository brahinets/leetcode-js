# 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

## Easy

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in
its binary representation. For example, The integer `5` is `101` in binary and its complement is `010` which is the
integer `2`. Given an integer `num`, return its complement.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= n < 10^9`
