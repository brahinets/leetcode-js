# 1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs

## Medium

You are given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `distance`. A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary tree
is said to be good if the length of the shortest path between them is less than or equal to `distance`. Return the
number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2^10]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= distance <= 10`
