# 119. Pascal's Triangle II

## Easy

Given an integer `rowIndex`, return the `rowIndex-th` (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

### Constraints:

- `0 <= rowIndex <= 33`

**Follow up:** Could you optimize your algorithm to use only `O(rowIndex)` extra space?
