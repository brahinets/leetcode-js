# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the k-th largest element in the array.
Note that it is the k-th largest element in the sorted order, not the k-th distinct element.
Can you solve it without sorting?

Constraints:

`1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
