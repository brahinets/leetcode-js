# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Easy

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique
element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique
elements in nums. Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the
following things: Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the
order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return `k`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
