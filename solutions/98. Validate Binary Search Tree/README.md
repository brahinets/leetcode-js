# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

## Medium

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). The left subtree of a node
contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys
greater than the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`
