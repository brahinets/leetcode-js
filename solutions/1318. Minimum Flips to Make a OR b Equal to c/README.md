# 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c

# Medium

Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to
make ( `a OR b == c` ). (bitwise OR operation). Flip operation consists of change any single bit `1` to `0` or change
the bit `0` to `1` in their binary representation.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= a <= 10^9`
- `1 <= b <= 10^9`
- `1 <= c <= 10^9`
