# 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference

## Medium

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is
an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference. A
subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of
the remaining elements.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4`
