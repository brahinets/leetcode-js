# Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

## Easy

Given a `m x n` matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of
negative numbers in grid.

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(n + m)` solution?
