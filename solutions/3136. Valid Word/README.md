# 3136. Valid Word

## Easy

A word is considered valid if:

- It contains a minimum of 3 characters.
- It contains only digits (0-9), and English letters (uppercase and lowercase).
- It includes at least one vowel.
- It includes at least one consonant.

You are given a string `word`. Return `true` if word is valid, otherwise, return `false`.

Notes: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, and their uppercases are vowels. A consonant is an English letter that is not a vowel.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= word.length <= 20`
- `word` consists of English uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, `@`, `#`, and `$`.
