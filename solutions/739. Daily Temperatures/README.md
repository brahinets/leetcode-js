# 739. Daily Temperatures

## Medium

Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such
that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no
future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5`
- `30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100`
