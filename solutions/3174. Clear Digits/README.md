# 3174. Clear Digits

## Easy

You are given a string `s`. Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly: Delete the first digit
and the closest non-digit character to its left. Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
- The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.
