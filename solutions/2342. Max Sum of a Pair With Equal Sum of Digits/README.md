# 2342. Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits

## Medium

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` consisting of positive integers. You can choose two indices `i` and `j`, such
that `i != j`, and the sum of digits of the number `nums[i]` is equal to that of `nums[j]`. Return the maximum value of
`nums[i] + nums[j]` that you can obtain over all possible indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions.

### Constraints:

â€“ `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
