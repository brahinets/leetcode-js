# 3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions

## Medium

You are given two integer arrays, `skill` and `mana`, of length `n` and `m`, respectively. In a laboratory, `n` wizards
must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity `mana[j]` and must pass through all the wizards
sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the `ith` wizard on the `jth` potion is
`timeij = skill[i] * mana[j]`. Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard
immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each
wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹ Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions
to be brewed properly.

### Constraints:

- `n == skill.length`
- `m == mana.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 5000`
- `1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000`
