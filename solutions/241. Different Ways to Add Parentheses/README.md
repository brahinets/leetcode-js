# 241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses

## Medium

Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return all possible results from computing all the different
possible ways to group numbers and operators. You may return the answer in any order. The test cases are generated such
that the output values fit in a 32-bit integer and the number of different results does not exceed `10^4`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= expression.length <= 20`
- `expression` consists of digits and the operator `+`, `-`, and `*`.
- All the integer values in the input expression are in the range `[0, 99]`.
