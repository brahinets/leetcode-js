# 1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

## Medium

Given the string `s`, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is,
`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u` must appear an even number of times.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
