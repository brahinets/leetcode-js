# 3446. Sort Matrix by Diagonals

## Medium

You are given an `n x n` square matrix of integers `grid`. Return the matrix such that:

- The diagonals in the bottom-left triangle (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in non-increasing order.
- The diagonals in the top-right triangle are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Constraints:

- `grid.length == grid[i].length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `-10^5 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5`
