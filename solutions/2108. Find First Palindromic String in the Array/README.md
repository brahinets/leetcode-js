# 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array

## Easy

Given an array of strings `words`, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return
an empty string ` `. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
