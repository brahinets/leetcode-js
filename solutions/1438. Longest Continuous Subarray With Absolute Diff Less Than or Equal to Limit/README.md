# 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

## Medium

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that
the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= limit <= 10^9`
