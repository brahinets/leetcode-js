# 133. Clone Graph

## Medium

Given a reference to a node in a **connected** undirected graph.

Return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with
`val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency
list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the
set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a
reference to the cloned graph.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
