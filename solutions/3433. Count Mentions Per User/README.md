# 3433. Count Mentions Per User

## Medium

You are given an integer `numberOfUsers` representing the total number of users and an array `events` of size `n x 3`.

Each `events[i]` can be either of the following two types:

1. Message Event: `["MESSAGE", "timestampi", "mentions_stringi"]`

- This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at `timestampi`.
- The `mentions_stringi` string can contain one of the following tokens:
    - `id<number>`: where `<number>` is an integer in range `[0,numberOfUsers - 1]`. There can be multiple ids separated
      by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
    - `ALL`: mentions all users.
    - `HERE`: mentions all online users.

2. Offline Event: `["OFFLINE", "timestampi", "idi"]`

- This event indicates that the user `idi` had become offline at `timestampi` for `60` time units. The user will
  automatically be online again at time `timestampi + 60`.

Return an array `mentions` where `mentions[i]` represents the number of mentions the user with id `i` has across all
`MESSAGE` events. All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change
is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp. Note that a user can be mentioned
multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= numberOfUsers <= 100`
- `1 <= events.length <= 100`
- `events[i].length == 3`
- `events[i][0]` will be one of `MESSAGE` or `OFFLINE.`
- `1 <= int(events[i][1]) <= 10^5`
- The number of `id<number>` mentions in any `"MESSAGE"` event is between `1` and `100`
- `0 <= <number> <= numberOfUsers - 1`
- It is guaranteed that the user id referenced in the `OFFLINE` event is online at the time the event occurs.
