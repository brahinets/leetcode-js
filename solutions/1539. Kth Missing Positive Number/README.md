# 1539. K-th Missing Positive Number

## Easy

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`.
Return the k-th positive integer that is missing from this array.

### Constraints:
`1 <= arr.length <= 1000`  
`1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`  
`1 <= k <= 1000`  
`arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length`
