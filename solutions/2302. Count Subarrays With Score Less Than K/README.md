# 2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K

## Hard

The score of an array is defined as the product of its sum and its length. For example, the score of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
is `(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75`. Given a positive integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of
non-empty subarrays of `nums` whose score is strictly less than `k`. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements
within an array.

### Constraints:

– `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
– `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
– `1 <= k <= 10^15`
