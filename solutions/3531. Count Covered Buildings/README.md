# 3531. Count Covered Buildings

## Medium

You are given a positive integer `n`, representing an `n x n` city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where
`buildings[i] = [x, y]` denotes a unique building located at coordinates `[x, y]` A building is covered if there is at
least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below. Return the number of covered buildings.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= buildings.length <= 10^5`
- `buildings[i] = [x, y]`
- `1 <= x, y <= n`
- All coordinates of buildings are unique.
