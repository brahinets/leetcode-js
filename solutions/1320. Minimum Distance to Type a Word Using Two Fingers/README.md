# 1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers

## Hard

You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the **XY** plane, where each English uppercase letter is located at some coordinate.

- For example, the letter `'A'` is located at coordinate `(0, 0)`, the letter `'B'` is located at coordinate `(0, 1)`, the letter `'P'` is located at coordinate `(2, 3)` and the letter `'Z'` is located at coordinate `(4, 1)`.

Given the string `word`, return the minimum total **distance** to type such string using only two fingers.

The **distance** between coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

Note that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so don't count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to start at the first letter or the first two letters.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= word.length <= 300`
- `word` consists of uppercase English letters.
