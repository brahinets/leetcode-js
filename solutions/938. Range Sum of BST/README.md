# 938. Range Sum of BST

## Easy

Given the `root` node of a binary search tree and two integers `low` and `high`, return the sum of values of all nodes
with a value in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `1 <= low <= high <= 10^5`
- All `Node.val` are unique.
