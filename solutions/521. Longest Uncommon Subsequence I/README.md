# 521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

## Easy

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between `a` and `b`. If no such
uncommon subsequence exists, return `-1`. An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence
of exactly one of them.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
