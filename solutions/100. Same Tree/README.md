# 100. Same Tree

## Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not. Two binary trees
are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
