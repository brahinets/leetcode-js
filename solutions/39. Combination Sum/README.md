# 39. Combination Sum

## Medium

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations
of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order. The same number
may be chosen from `candidates` an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least
one of the chosen numbers is different. The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that
sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
- `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
- All elements of `candidates` are distinct.
- `1 <= target <= 40`
