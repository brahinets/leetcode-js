# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

## Medium

Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced
binary search tree.

**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in head is in the range `[0, 2 * 10^4]`.
`-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
