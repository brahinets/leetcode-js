# 1621. Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments

## Medium

Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `ith` point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw **exactly** `k` **non-overlapping** line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each line segment must have **integral coordinates**. The `k` line segments do not have to cover all `n` points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.

Return the number of ways we can draw `k` non-overlapping line segments. Since this number can be huge, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= n-1`
