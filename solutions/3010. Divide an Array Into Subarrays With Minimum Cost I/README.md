# Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost I

## Easy

You are given an array of integers `nums` of length `n`.

The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of `[1,2,3]` is `1` while the cost of `[3,4,1]` is `3`.

You need to divide `nums` into `3` disjoint contiguous subarrays.

Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.

### Constraints:

- `3 <= n <= 50`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
