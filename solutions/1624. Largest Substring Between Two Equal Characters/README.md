# 1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters

## Easy

Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two
characters. If there is no such substring return `-1`. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a
string.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 300`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
