# 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

## Medium

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` consisting of positive integers. There are two types of operations that you can
apply on the array any number of times:

- Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
- Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.

- Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or `-1` if it is not possible.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
