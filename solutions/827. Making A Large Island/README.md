# 827. Making A Large Island

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`. You are allowed to change at most one `0` to be `1`. Return the size of
the largest island in `grid` after applying this operation. An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s.

### Constraints:

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
