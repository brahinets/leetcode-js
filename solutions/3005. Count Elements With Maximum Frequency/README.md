# 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency

## Easy

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such
that those elements all have the maximum frequency. The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that
element in the array.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
