# 3487. Maximum Unique Subarray Sum After Deletion

## Easy

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are allowed to delete any number of elements from `nums` without making it
empty. After performing the deletions, select a subarray of `nums` such that:

1. All elements in the subarray are unique.
2. The sum of the elements in the subarray is maximized.

Return the maximum sum of such a subarray.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
