# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of nums are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer
appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice. You must write an algorithm that runs
in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- Each element in 'nums' appears once or twice.
