# 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

## Medium

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to
right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
