# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

## Easy

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal. Given `a` string s, delete the minimum
possible number of characters from `s` to make it fancy. Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown
that the answer will always be unique.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
