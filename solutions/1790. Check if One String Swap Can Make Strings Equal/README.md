# 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

## Easy

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a
string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices. Return `true` if it is possible to make
both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Constraints:

– `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
– `s1.length == s2.length`
– `s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.
