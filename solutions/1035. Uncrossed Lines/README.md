# 1035. Uncrossed Lines

## Medium

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. We write the integers of `nums1` and `nums2` (in the order they
are given) on two separate horizontal lines. We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two
numbers `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` such that: `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`, and the line we draw does not intersect any other
connecting (non-horizontal) line. Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number
can only belong to one connecting line). Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

### Constraints:

`1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
`1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 2000`
