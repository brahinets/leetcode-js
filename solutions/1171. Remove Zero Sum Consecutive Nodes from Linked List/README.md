# 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

## Medium

Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are
no such sequences. After doing so, return the head of the final linked list. You may return any such answer.

### Constraints:

- The given linked list will contain between `1` and `1000` nodes.
- Each node in the linked list has `-1000 <= node.val <= 1000`.
