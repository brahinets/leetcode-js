# 1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows

## Medium

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `matrix`. You can choose any number of columns in the `matrix` and flip every
cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from `0` to `1` or vice versa). Return the maximum number of
rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.

### Constraints:

– `m == matrix.length`
– `n == matrix[i].length`
– `1 <= m, n <= 300`
– `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
