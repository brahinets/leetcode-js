# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

## Medium

Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `inorder` where `preorder` is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and
`inorder` is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= preorder.length <= 3000`
- `inorder.length == preorder.length`
- `-3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000`
- `preorder` and `inorder` consist of unique values.
- Each value of `inorder` also appears in `preorder`.
- `preorder` is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
- `inorder` is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.
