# 446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence

## Hard

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of `nums`. A sequence of numbers is
called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements
is the same. The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
