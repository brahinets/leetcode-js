# 2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence

## Medium

You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters. Return the minimum number of
characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of `s`. A subsequence is a
string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the
remaining characters.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
