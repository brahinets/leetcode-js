# 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

## Easy

A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters. A word is
uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence. Given two
sentences `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `s1` and `s2` do not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s1` and `s2` are separated by a single space.
