# 590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal

## Easy

Given the `root` of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values. Nary-Tree input serialization is
represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
