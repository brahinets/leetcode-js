# 2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers

## Medium

Given two positive integers `n` and `x`. Return the number of ways `n` can be expressed as the sum of the `xth` power of
unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers `[n1, n2, ..., nk]` where
`n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx`. Since the result can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`. For example, if `n = 160`
and `x = 3`, one way to express `n` is `n = 23 + 33 + 53`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `1 <= x <= 5`
