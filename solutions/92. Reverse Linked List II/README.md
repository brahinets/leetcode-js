# 92. Reverse Linked List II

## Medium

Given the `head` of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of
the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`
