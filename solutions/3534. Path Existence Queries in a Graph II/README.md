# 3534. Path Existence Queries in a Graph II

## Hard

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `maxDiff`.

An **undirected** edge exists between nodes `i` and `j` if the **absolute** difference between `nums[i]` and
`nums[j]` is **at most** `maxDiff` (i.e., `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff`).

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [ui, vi]`, find the **minimum** distance
between nodes `ui` and `vi`. If no path exists between the two nodes, return -1 for that query.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `ith` query.

**Note:** The edges between the nodes are unweighted.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `0 <= maxDiff <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i] == [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
