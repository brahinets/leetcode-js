# 867. Transpose Matrix

## Easy

Given a 2D integer array `matrix`, return the transpose of matrix. The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over
its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

### Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9`
