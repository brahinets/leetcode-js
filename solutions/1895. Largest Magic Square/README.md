# 1895. Largest Magic Square

## Medium

A `k x k` magic square is a `k x k` grid filled with integers such that every row sum, every column sum, and both
diagonal sums are all equal. The integers in the magic square do not have to be distinct. Every `1 x 1` grid is
trivially a magic square. Given an `m x n` integer `grid`, return the size (i.e., the side length `k`) of the largest
magic square that can be found within this grid.

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^6`
