# 518. Coin Change II

## Medium

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing
a total amount of money. Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be
made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`. You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of
coin. The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
- All the values of coins are unique.
- `0 <= amount <= 5000`
