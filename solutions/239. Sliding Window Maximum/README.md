# 239. Sliding Window Maximum

## Hard

You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of
the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by
one position. Return the max sliding window.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
