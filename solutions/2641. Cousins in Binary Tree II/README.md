# 2641. Cousins in Binary Tree II

## Medium

Given the `root` of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the sum of all its cousins' values.
Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents. Return the `root` of the
modified tree. Note that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
