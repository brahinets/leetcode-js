# 564. Find the Closest Palindrome

## Hard

Given a string `n` representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If
there is a tie, return the smaller one. The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two
integers.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n.length <= 18`
- `n` consists of only digits.
- `n` does not have leading zeros.
- `n` is representing an integer in the range `[1, 10^18 - 1]`.
