# 2134. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II

## Medium

A swap is defined as taking two distinct positions in an array and swapping the values in them. A circular array is
defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent. Given a binary circular
array `nums`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all `1`'s present in the array together at any
location.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`
