# 756. Pyramid Transition Matrix

## Medium

You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of
blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top. To make the pyramid aesthetically
pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block
stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings `allowed`, where the first two
characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top
block. For example, `ABC` represents a triangular pattern with a `C` block stacked on top of an `A` (left) and `B` (
right) block. Note that this is different from `BAC` where `B` is on the left bottom and `A` is on the right bottom. You
start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid. Given
`bottom` and `allowed`, return `true` if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that every triangular
pattern in the pyramid is in `allowed`, or `false` otherwise.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= bottom.length <= 6`
- `0 <= allowed.length <= 216`
- `allowed[i].length == 3`
- The letters in all input strings are from the set {`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`}.
- All the values of `allowed` are unique.
