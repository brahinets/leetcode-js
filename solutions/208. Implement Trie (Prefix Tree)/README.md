# 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

## Medium

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a
dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the `Trie` class:

- `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
- `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string word into the trie.
- `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string word is in the `trie` (i.e., was inserted before),
  and `false` otherwise.
- `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string word that has the
  prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
- `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- At most `3 * 10^4` calls in total will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.
