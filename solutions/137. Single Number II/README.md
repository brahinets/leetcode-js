# 137. Single Number II

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find
the single element and return it. You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant
extra space.

### Constraints:

`1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
`-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
