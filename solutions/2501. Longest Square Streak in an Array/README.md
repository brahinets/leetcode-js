# 2501. Longest Square Streak in an Array

## Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subsequence of `nums` is called a square streak if: The length of the
subsequence is at least `2`, and after sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the square of
the previous number. Return the length of the longest square streak in nums, or return `-1` if there is no square
streak. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without
changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `2 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
