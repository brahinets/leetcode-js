# 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST

## Easy

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two
different nodes in the tree.

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^4]`.
`0 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Note:** This question is the same as 783: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/
