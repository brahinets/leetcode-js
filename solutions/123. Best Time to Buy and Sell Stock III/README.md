## Hard

You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day. Find the maximum profit
you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy
again).

### Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`
