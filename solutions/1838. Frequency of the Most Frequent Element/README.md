# 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

## Medium

The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array. You are given an integer array `nums` and an
integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`. Return
the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most `k` operations.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
