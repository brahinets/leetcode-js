# 1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency

## Easy

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple
values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order. Return the sorted array.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
