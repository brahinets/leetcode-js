# 945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique

## Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can pick an index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length` and increment `nums[i]` by `1`. Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in `nums` unique. The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.


### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
