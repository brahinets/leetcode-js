# 1903. Largest Odd Number in String

## Easy

You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is
a non-empty substring of `num`, or an empty string `""` if no odd integer exists. A substring is a contiguous sequence
of characters within a string.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= num.length <= 10^5`
- `num` only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.
