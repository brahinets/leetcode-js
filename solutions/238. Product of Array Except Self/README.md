# 238. Product of Array Except Self

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array answer such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements
of nums except `nums[i]`. The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer. You
must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

### Constraints:

`2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra
space for space complexity analysis.)
