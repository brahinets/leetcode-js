# 3191. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I

## Medium

You are given a binary array `nums`. You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly
zero): Choose any `3` consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them. Flipping an element means changing its
value from `0` to `1`, and from `1` to `0`. Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in
nums equal to `1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

### Constraints:

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1`
