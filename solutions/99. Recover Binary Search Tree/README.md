# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

## Medium

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped
by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant `O(1)` space
solution?
