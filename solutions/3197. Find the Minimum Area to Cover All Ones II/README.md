# 3197. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II

## Hard

You are given a 2D binary array `grid`. You need to find 3 non-overlapping rectangles having non-zero areas with
horizontal and vertical sides such that all the 1's in `grid` lie inside these rectangles. Return the minimum possible
sum of the area of these rectangles. Note that the rectangles are allowed to touch.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`
- The input is generated such that there are at least three 1's in `grid`
