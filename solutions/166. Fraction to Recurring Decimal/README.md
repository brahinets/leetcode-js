# 166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal

## Medium

Given two integers representing the `numerator` and `denominator` of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.
If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses. If multiple answers are possible, return
any of them. It is guaranteed that the length of the answer string is less than `10^4` for all the given inputs.

### Constraints:

- `-2^31 <= numerator, denominator <= 2^31 - 1`
- `denominator != 0`
