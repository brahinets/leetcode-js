# 445. Add Two Numbers II

## Medium

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first
and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume
the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without reversing the input lists?
