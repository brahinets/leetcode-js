# 86. Partition List

## Medium

Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes less than `x` come before nodes
greater than or equal to `x`. You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two
partitions.

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.
`-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
`-200 <= x <= 200`
