# 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

## Medium

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given
target value. If target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`. You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)`
runtime complexity.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
