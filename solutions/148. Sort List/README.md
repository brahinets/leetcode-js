Given the `head` of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?
