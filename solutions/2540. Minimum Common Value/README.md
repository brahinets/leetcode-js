# 2540. Minimum Common Value

## Easy

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum integer common to both
arrays. If there is no common integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`. Note that an integer is said to be
common to `nums1` and `nums2` if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`
- Both `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
