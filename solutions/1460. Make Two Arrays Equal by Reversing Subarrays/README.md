# 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays

## Easy

You are given two integer arrays of equal length `target` and `arr`. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray
of `arr` and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps. Return `true` if you can make arr equal to
`target` or `false` otherwise.

### Constraints:

- `target.length == arr.length`
- `1 <= target.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= target[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
