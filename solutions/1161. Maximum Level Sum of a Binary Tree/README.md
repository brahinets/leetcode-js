# 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

## Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of its children is `2`, and so on. Return the
smallest level `x` such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level `x` is maximal.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
