# 1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k

## Medium

Given an array of integers `arr` of even length `n` and an integer `k`. We want to divide the array into exactly `n / 2`
pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`. Return `true` If you can find a way to do that or `false`
otherwise.

### Constraints:

- `arr.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `n is even.`
- `-109 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
