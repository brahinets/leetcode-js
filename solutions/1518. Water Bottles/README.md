# 1518. Water Bottles

## Easy

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water
bottles from the market with one full water bottle. The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty
bottle. Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
- `2 <= numExchange <= 100`
