# 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

## Easy

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings `words`. A string is
consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`. Return the number of consistent strings in
the array `words`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= allowed.length <= 26`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- The characters in `allowed` are distinct.
- `words[i]` and `allowed` contain only lowercase English letters.
