# 2516. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right

## Medium

You are given a string `s` consisting of the characters `a`, `b`, and `c` and a non-negative integer `k`. Each minute,
you may take either the leftmost character of `s`, or the rightmost character of `s`. Return the minimum number of
minutes needed for you to take at least `k` of each character, or return `-1` if it is not possible to take `k` of each
character.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only the letters `a`, `b`, and `c`
- `0 <= k <= s.length`
