# 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

## Medium

Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until all occurrences of the substring `part`
are removed: Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` and remove it from `s`. Return `s` after removing all
occurrences of `part`. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= part.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `part` consists of lowercase English letters.
