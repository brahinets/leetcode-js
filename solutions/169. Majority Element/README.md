# 169. Majority Element

## Easy

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more
than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
