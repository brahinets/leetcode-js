# 3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array

## Medium

You are given an array of integers `nums` and the `head` of a linked list. Return the `head` of the modified linked list
after removing all nodes from the linked list that have a value that exists in `nums`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- All elements in `nums` are unique.
- The number of nodes in the given list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- The input is generated such that there is at least one node in the linked list that has a value not present in `nums`.
