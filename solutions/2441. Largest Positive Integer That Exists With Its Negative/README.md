# 2441. Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative

## Easy

Given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zeros, find the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` also
exists in the array. Return the positive integer `k`. If there is no such integer, return `-1`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `nums[i] != 0`
