# 664. Strange Printer

## Hard

There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:

- The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
- At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original
  existing characters.

Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
