# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

## Easy

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly
`1`. Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible
subsequences.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
