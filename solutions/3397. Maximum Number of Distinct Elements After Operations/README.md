# 3397. Maximum Number of Distinct Elements After Operations

## Medium

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You are allowed to perform the following operation on each
element of the array at most once: Add an integer in the range `[-k, k]` to the element. Return the maximum possible
number of distinct elements in `nums` after performing the operations.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= k <= 10^9`
