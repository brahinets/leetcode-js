# 7. Reverse Integer

## Medium

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside
the signed 32-bit integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then return `0`. Assume the environment does not allow you to store
64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

### Constraints:

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
