# 1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence

## Easy

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the
same. Given an `array` of numbers arr, return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression.
Otherwise, return `false`.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
