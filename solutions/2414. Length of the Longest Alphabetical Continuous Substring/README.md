# 2414. Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring

## Medium

An alphabetical continuous string is a string consisting of consecutive letters in the alphabet. In other words, it is
any substring of the string `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`. For example, `abc` is an alphabetical continuous string, while
`acb` and `a` are not. Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters only, return the length of the longest
alphabetical continuous substring.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.
