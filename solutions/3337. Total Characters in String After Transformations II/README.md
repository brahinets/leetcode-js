# 3337. Total Characters in String After Transformations II

## Hard

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer `t` representing the number of
transformations to perform, and an array `nums` of size `26`. In one transformation, every character in `s` is replaced
according to the following rules: Replace `s[i]` with the next `nums[s[i] - 'a']` consecutive characters in the
alphabet. For example, if `s[i] = 'a'` and `nums[0] = 3`, the character `a` transforms into the next `3` consecutive
characters ahead of it, which results in `bcd`. The transformation wraps around the alphabet if it exceeds `z`. For
example, if `s[i] = 'y'` and `nums[24] = 3`, the character `y` transforms into the next `3` consecutive characters ahead
of it, which results in `zab`. Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations. Since the
answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= t <= 10^9`
- `nums.length == 26`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 25`
