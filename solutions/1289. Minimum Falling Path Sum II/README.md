# 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II

## Hard

Given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts. A falling path
with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of `grid` such that no two elements chosen in
adjacent rows are in the same column.

### Constraints:

- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `-99 <= grid[i][j] <= 99`
