# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

## Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree. In a complete binary tree, every level,
except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have
between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

### Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
`1 <= Node.val <= 1000`
