# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

## Medium

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers
from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
