# 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference

## Easy

Given an array of distinct integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two
elements.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair `[a, b]` follows

- `a`, `b` are from arr
- `a < b`
- `b - a` equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in `arr`

### Constraints:

- `2 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
