# 1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

## Medium

Given a string `s`, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of `s`. Note that
even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once. A palindrome is a string
that reads the same forwards and backwards. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. For
example, `ace` is a subsequence of `abcde`.

### Constraints:

- `3 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
