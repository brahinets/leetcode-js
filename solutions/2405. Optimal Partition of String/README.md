# 2405. Optimal Partition of String

## Medium

Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are
unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once. Return the minimum number of substrings in such
a partition. Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.
