# 788. Rotated Digits

## Easy

An integer `x` is a **good** if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is **different** from `x`. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid after rotation if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored); 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of **good** integers in the range `[1, n]`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 10000`
