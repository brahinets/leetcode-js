# 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle

## Easy

Given an integer array `nums`, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of
these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

### Constraints:

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
