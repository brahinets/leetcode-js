# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth. A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along
the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
