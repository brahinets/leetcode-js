# 589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

## Easy

Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values. N-ary-Tree input serialization is
represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.  
`0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`  
The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
