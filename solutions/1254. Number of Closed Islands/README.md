# 1254. Number of Closed Islands

## Medium

Given a 2D grid consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water). An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s`
and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s`. Return the number of closed
islands.

### Constraints:

`1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100`  
`0 <= grid[i][j] <=1`
