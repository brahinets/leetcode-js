# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

## Easy

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in
non-decreasing order.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using
a different approach?
