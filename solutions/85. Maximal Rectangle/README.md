# 85. Maximal Rectangle

## Hard

Given a `rows x cols` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s and
return its area.

### Constraints:

- `rows == matrix.length`
- `cols == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= row, cols <= 200`
- `matrix[i][j]` is `0` or `1`
