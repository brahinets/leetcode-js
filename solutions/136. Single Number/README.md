# 136. Single Number

## Easy

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
