# 2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number

## Medium

An integer `x` is numerically balanced if for every digit `d` in the number `x`, there are exactly `d` occurrences of
that digit in `x`. Given an integer `n`, return the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than `n`.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= n <= 10^6`
