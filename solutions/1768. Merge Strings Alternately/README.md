# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

## Easy

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting
with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

### Constraints:

`1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
`word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
