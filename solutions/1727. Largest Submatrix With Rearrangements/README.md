# 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements

## Medium

You are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and you are allowed to rearrange the columns of the matrix in
any order. Return the area of the largest submatrix within matrix where every element of the submatrix is `1` after
reordering the columns optimally.

### Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`
