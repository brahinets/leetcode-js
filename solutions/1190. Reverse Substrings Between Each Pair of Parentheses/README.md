# 1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses

## Medium

You are given a string `s` that consists of lower case English letters and brackets. Reverse the strings in each pair of
matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one. Your result should not contain any brackets.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` only contains lower case English characters and parentheses.
- It is guaranteed that all parentheses are balanced.
