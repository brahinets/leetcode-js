# 1914. Cyclically Rotating a Grid

## Medium

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where `m` and `n` are both even integers, and an integer `k`.

The matrix is composed of several layers, which is shown in the below image, where each color is its own layer:

A cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating **each layer** in the matrix. To cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the **counter-clockwise** direction. An example rotation is shown below:

Return the matrix after applying `k` cyclic rotations to it.

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= m, n <= 50`
- Both `m` and `n` are even integers.
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 5000`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
