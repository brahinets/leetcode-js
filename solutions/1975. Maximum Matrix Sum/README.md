# 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum

## Medium

You are given an `n x n` integer `matrix`. You can do the following operation any number of times. Choose any two
adjacent elements of `matrix` and multiply each of them by `-1`. Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if
they share a border. Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the
matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

### Constraints:

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `2 <= n <= 250`
- `-10^5 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5`
