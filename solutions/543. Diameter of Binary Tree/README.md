# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

## Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the
length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The length
of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4].`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
