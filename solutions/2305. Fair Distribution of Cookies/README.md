# 2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies

## Medium

You are given an integer array cookies, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the ith bag. You are also
given an integer `k` that denotes the number of children to distribute all the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in
the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up. The unfairness of a distribution is defined as the
maximum total cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution. Return the minimum unfairness of all
distributions.

### Constraints:

`2 <= cookies.length <= 8`
`1 <= cookies[i] <= 10^5`
`2 <= k <= cookies.length`
