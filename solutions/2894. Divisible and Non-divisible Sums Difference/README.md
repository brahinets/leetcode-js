# 2894. Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference

## Easy

You are given positive integers `n` and `m`. Define two integers as follows:

- `num1`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` (both inclusive) that are not divisible by `m`.
- `num2`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` (both inclusive) that are divisible by `m`.

Return the integer `num1 - num2`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
