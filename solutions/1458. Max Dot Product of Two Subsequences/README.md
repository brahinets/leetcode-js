# 1458. Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences

## Hard

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of `nums1` and
`nums2` with the same length. A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by
deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (
ie, `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
