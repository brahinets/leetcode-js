# 729. My Calendar I

## Medium

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a
double booking. A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common
to both events.). The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that represents a booking on the
half-open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Implement the `MyCalendar` class:

â€“ `MyCalendar()` Initializes the calendar object.

- `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without
  causing a double booking. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= start < end <= 10^9`
- At most `1000` calls will be made to book.
