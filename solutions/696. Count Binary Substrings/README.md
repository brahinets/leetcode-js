# 696. Count Binary Substrings

## Easy

Given a binary string `s`, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of `0`'s and `1`'s, and all the `0`'s and all the `1`'s in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`
