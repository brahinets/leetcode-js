# 3625. Count Number of Trapezoids II

## Hard

You are given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the `ith` point on
the Cartesian plane. Return the number of unique trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from
`points`. A trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. Two lines are parallel if and
only if they have the same slope.

### Constraints:

- `4 <= points.length <= 500`
- `–1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000`
- All points are pairwise distinct.
