# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

## Medium

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals
you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

### Constraints:

`1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
`intervals[i].length == 2`
`-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`
