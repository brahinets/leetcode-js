# 1382. Balance a Binary Search Tree

## Medium

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is
more than one answer, return any of them. A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every
node never differs by more than `1`.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
