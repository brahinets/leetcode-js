# 2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K

## Medium

You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`. Return the length of the longest subsequence of `s` that
makes up a binary number less than or equal to `k`.

**Note:**

- The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
- The empty string is considered to be equal to `0`.
- A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing
  the order of the remaining characters.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `0` or `1`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
