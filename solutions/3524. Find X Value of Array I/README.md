# 3524. Find X Value of Array I

## Medium

You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums`, and a **positive** integer `k`.

You are allowed to perform an operation **once** on `nums`, where in each operation you can remove any **non-overlapping** prefix and suffix from `nums` such that `nums` remains **non-empty**.

You need to find the **x-value** of `nums`, which is the number of ways to perform this operation so that the **product** of the remaining elements leaves a *remainder* of `x` when divided by `k`.

Return an array `result` of size `k` where `result[x]` is the **x-value** of `nums` for `0 <= x <= k - 1`.

A **prefix** of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

A **suffix** of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array.

**Note** that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be **empty**.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 5`
