# 3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

## Easy

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the maximum difference
`diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2)` between the frequency of characters `a1` and `a2` in the string such that:

- `a1` has an odd frequency in the string.
- `a2` has an even frequency in the string.

Return this maximum difference.

### Constraints:

– `3 <= s.length <= 100`
– `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
– `s` contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
