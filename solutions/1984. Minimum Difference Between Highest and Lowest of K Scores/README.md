# 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores

## Easy

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `i`th student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the `k` scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
