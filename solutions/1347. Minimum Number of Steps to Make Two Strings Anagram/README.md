# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

## Medium

You are given two strings of the same length `s` and `t`. In one step you can choose any character of `t` and replace it with another character. Return the minimum number of steps to make `t` an anagram of `s`. An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s.length == t.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.
