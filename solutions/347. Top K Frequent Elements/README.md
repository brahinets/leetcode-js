# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements.
You may return the answer in any order.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the array's size.
