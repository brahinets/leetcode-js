# 956. Tallest Billboard

## Hard

You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one
on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height. You are given a collection of `rods` that can be welded
together. For example, if you have rods of lengths `1`, `2`, and `3`, you can weld them together to make a support of
length `6`. Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the billboard,
return `0`.

### Constraints:

`1 <= rods.length <= 20`
`1 <= rods[i] <= 1000`
`sum(rods[i]) <= 5000`
