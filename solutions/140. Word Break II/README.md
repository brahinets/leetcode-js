# 140. Word Break II

## Hard

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is
a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order. Note that the same word in the dictionary may
be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10`
- `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `wordDict` are unique.
- Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed `10^5`.
