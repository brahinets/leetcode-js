# 791. Custom Sort String

## Medium

You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are unique and were sorted in some custom order
previously. Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a
character `x` occurs before a character `y` in order, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string. Return
any permutation of `s` that satisfies this property.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= order.length <= 26`
- `1 <= s.length <= 200`
- `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.`
- All the characters of order are unique.
