# 1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists

## Medium

You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively. Remove `list1`'s nodes from
the `ath` node to the `bth` node, and put `list2` in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the following figure
indicate the result: Build the result list and return its head.

### Constraints:

- `3 <= list1.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1`
- `1 <= list2.length <= 10^4`
