# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

## Medium

You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee
representing a transaction fee. Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you
like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy
again).

### Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4`
