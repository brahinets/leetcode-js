# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence

## Medium

Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `nums`.

**Note that:**

- A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the
  order of the remaining elements.
- A sequence `seq` is arithmetic if `seq[i + 1] - seq[i]` are all the same value `(for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1)`.

### Constraints:

`2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
`0 <= nums[i] <= 500`
