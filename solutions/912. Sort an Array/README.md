# 912. Sort an Array

## Medium

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it. You must solve the problem without
using any built-in functions in `O(n^log(n))` time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4`
