# 3634. Minimum Removals to Balance Array

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, an array is **balanced** if the value of its maximum element is at most `k` times the minimum element.

You may remove any number of elements from `nums` without making it empty.

Return the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced.

**Note:** An array of size `1` is always considered balanced.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
