# 1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array

## Hard

You are given an integer array `target`. You have an integer array `initial` of the same size as `target` with all
elements initially zeros. In one operation you can choose any subarray from `initial` and increment each value by one.
Return the minimum number of operations to form a `target` array from `initial`. The test cases are generated so that
the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= target[i] <= 10^5`
