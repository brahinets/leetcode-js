# 1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings

## Medium

Given a string `s`, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into. You can
split string `s` into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original
string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique. A substring is a contiguous sequence of
characters within a string.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 16`
- `s` contains only lower case English letters.
