# 2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock

## Medium

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock
price on the `ith` day. A smooth descent period of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days such that the price
on each day is lower than the price on the preceding day by exactly `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from
this rule. Return the number of smooth descent periods.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`
