# 3454. Separate Squares II

## Hard

You are given a 2D integer array `squares`. Each `squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]` represents the coordinates of the
bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis. Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a
horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line equals the total area covered by squares
below the line. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be accepted. Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping
areas should be counted only once in this version.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]`
- `squares[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9`
- `1 <= li <= 10^9`
- The total area of all the squares will not exceed `10^15`
