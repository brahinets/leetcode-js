# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

## Easy

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^5]`.
`-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
