# 1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping

## Medium

You are given a circle represented as `(radius, xCenter, yCenter)` and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as
`(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, where `(x1, y1)` are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` are the
coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return `true` if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return `false`. In other words, check if there
is any point `(xi, yi)` that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= radius <= 2000`
- `-10^4 <= xCenter, yCenter <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= x1 < x2 <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= y1 < y2 <= 10^4`
