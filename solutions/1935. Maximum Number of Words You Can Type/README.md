# 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type

## Easy

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.
Given a string `text` of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string `brokenLetters`
of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in `text` you can fully type using this
keyboard.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= text.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26`
- `text` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
- Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
- `brokenLetters` consists of distinct lowercase English letters.
