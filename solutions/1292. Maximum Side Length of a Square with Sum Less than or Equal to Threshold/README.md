# 1292. Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to Threshold

## Medium

Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`, return the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than
or equal to `threshold` or return `0` if there is no such square.

### Constraints:

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `0 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4`
- `0 <= threshold <= 10^5`
