# 844. Backspace String Compare

## Easy

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a
backspace character. Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

### Constraints:

`1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200`
`s` and `t` only contain lowercase letters and `#` characters.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?
