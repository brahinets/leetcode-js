# 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List

## Medium

You are given the `head` of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes. Return
the `head` of the linked list after doubling it.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^4]`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number `0`
  itself.
