# 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation

## Easy

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the **count** of numbers in the inclusive range `[left, right]` whose binary representation is a **prime number**.

(Recall that a prime number is one greater than 1 which has no positive divisors other than itself and 1.)

### Constraints:
- `1 <= left <= right <= 10^6`
