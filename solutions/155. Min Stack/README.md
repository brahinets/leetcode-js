# 155. Min Stack

## Medium

Design a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `top`, and retrieving the `minimum` element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element val onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

### Constraints:

- `-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1`
- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
- At most `3 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.
