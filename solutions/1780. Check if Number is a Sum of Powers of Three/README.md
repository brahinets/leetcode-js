# 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three

## Medium

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three.
Otherwise, return `false`. An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3^x`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 10^7`
