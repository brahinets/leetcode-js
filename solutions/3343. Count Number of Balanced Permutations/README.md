# 3343. Count Number of Balanced Permutations

## Hard

You are given a string `num`. A string of digits is called balanced if the sum of the digits at even indices is equal to
the sum of the digits at odd indices. Return the number of distinct permutations of `num` that are balanced. Since the
answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`. A permutation is a rearrangement of all the characters of a
string.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= num.length <= 80`
- `num` consists of digits `0` to `9` only
