# 1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition

## Medium

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums
such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to target. Since the answer may be too
large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Constraints:

`1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
`1 <= target <= 10^6`
