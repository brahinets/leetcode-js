# 1980. Find Unique Binary String

## Medium

Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` unique binary strings each of length `n`, return a binary string of
length `n` that does not appear in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 16`
- `nums[i].length == n`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`
- All the strings of nums are unique.
