# 2053. Kth Distinct String in an Array

## Easy

A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array. Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer
`k`, return the `kth` distinct string present in `arr`. If there are fewer than `k` distinct strings, return an empty
string `""`. Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i].length <= 5`
- `arr[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
