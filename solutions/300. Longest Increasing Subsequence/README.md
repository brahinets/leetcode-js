# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
