# 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree

## Medium

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the
values in its subtree.

**Note:** The average of `n` elements is the `sum` of the `n` elements divided by `n` and rounded down to the nearest
integer. A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.

### Constraints:

– The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`
– `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
