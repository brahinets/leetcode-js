# 1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

## Easy

No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any `0` in its decimal representation. Given an integer `n`,
return a list of two integers `[a, b]` where: `a` and `b` are No-Zero integers. `a + b = n` The test cases are generated
so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 10^4`
