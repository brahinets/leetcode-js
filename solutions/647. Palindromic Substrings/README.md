# 647. Palindromic Substrings

## Medium

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it. A string is a palindrome when it reads the same
backward as forward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
