# 149. Max Points on a Line

## Hard

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane, return *the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line*.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= points.length <= 300`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4`
- All the `points` are unique.
