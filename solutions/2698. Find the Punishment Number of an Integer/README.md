# 2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer

## Medium

Given a positive integer `n`, return the punishment number of `n`. The punishment number of `n` is defined as the sum of
the squares of all integers `i` such that: `1 <= i <= n`. The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into
contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
