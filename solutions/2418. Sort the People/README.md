# 2418. Sort the People

## Easy

You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both
arrays are of length `n`. For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `ith`
person. Return `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

### Constraints:

- `n == names.length == heights.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^3`
- `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`
- `names[i]` consists of lower and upper case English letters.
- All the values of `heights` are distinct.
