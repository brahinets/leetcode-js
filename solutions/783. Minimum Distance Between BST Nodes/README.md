# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

## Easy

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different
nodes in the tree.

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.
`0 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Note:** This question is the same as [530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](../530.%20Minimum%20Absolute%20Difference%20in%20BST)
