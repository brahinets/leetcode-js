# 179. Largest Number

## Medium

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it. Since
the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
