# 3512. Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K

## Easy

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:
Select an index `i` and replace `nums[i]` with `nums[i] - 1`. Return the minimum number of operations required to make
the sum of the array divisible by `k`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 100`
