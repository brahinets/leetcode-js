# 2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency

## Medium

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. The frequency of an element `x` is the number of times it
occurs in an array. An array is called good if the frequency of each element in this array is less than or equal to `k`.
Return the length of the longest good subarray of `nums`. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements
within an array.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
