# 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

## Medium

Given a binary tree
`struct Node {
    int val;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;
    Node *next;
}`

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be
set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow-up:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
