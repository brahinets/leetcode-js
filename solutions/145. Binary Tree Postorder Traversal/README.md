# 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

## Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
