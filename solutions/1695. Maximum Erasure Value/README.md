# 1695. Maximum Erasure Value

## Medium

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score
you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements. Return the maximum score you can get by erasing
exactly one subarray. An array `b` is called to be a subarray of `a` if it forms a contiguous subsequence of `a`, that
is, if it is equal to `a[l],a[l+1],...,a[r]` for some `(l,r)`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
