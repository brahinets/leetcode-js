# 1726. Tuple with Same Product

## Medium

Given an array `nums` of distinct positive integers, return the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that
`a * b = c * d` where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are elements of `nums`, and `a != b != c != d`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- All elements in `nums` are distinct.
