# 1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings

## Medium

Given a string `s`, return the number of homogenous substrings of `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it
modulo `10^9 + 7`. A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same. A substring is a contiguous
sequence of characters within a string.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase letters.
