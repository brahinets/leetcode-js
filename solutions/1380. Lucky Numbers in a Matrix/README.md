# 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix

## Easy

Given an `m x n` matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order. A lucky number is an
element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

### Constraints:

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 50`
- `1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5`
- All elements in the matrix are distinct.
