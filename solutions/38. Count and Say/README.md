# 38. Count and Say

## Medium

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)` is the run-length encoding of `countAndSay(n - 1)`.
- Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (
  repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (
  length of the run). For example, to compress the string `3322251` we replace `33` with `23`, replace `222` with `32`,
  replace `5` with `15` and replace `1` with `11`. Thus the compressed string becomes `23321511`.

Given a positive integer `n`, return the `nth` element of the count-and-say sequence.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 30`
