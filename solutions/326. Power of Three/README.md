# 326. Power of Three

## Easy

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`. An integer `n` is a power of
three, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^x`.

### Constraints:

- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
