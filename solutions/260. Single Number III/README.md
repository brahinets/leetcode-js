# 260. Single Number III

## Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly
twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order. You must write an algorithm
that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.
