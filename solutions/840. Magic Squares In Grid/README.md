# 840. Magic Squares In Grid

## Medium

A `3 x 3` magic square is a `3 x 3` grid filled with distinct numbers from `1` to `9` such that each row, column, and
both diagonals all have the same sum. Given a `row x col` `grid` of integers, how many `3 x 3` contiguous magic square
subgrids are there? Note: while a magic square can only contain numbers from `1` to `9`, `grid` may contain numbers up
to `15`.

### Constraints:

- `row == grid.length`
- `col == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= row, col <= 10`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`
