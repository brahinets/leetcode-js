# 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

## Medium

You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`. Return the head of the linked list after swapping the
values of the `k-th` node from the beginning and the `k-th` node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
