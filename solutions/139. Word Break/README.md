# 139. Word Break

## Medium

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if s can be segmented into a space-separated
sequence of one or more dictionary words. Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the
segmentation.

### Constraints:

`1 <= s.length <= 300`
`1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
`1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
`s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of wordDict are unique.
