# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

## Easy

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i-th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost,
you can either climb one or two steps. You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.
Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`
