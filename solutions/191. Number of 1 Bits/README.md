# 191. Number of 1 Bits

## Easy

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of `1` bits it has (
also known as the Hamming weight). Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this
case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's
internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned. In Java, the compiler represents the
signed integers using 2's complement notation

### Constraints:

- The input must be a binary string of length `32`.

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
