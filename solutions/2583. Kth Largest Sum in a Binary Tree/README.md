# 2583. Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree

## Medium

You are given the root of a binary tree and a positive integer `k`. The level sum in the tree is the sum of the values
of the nodes that are on the same level. Return the `kth` largest level sum in the tree (not necessarily distinct). If
there are fewer than `k` levels in the tree, return `-1`. Note that two nodes are on the same level if they have the
same distance from the root.

### Constraints:

– The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
– `2 <= n <= 10^5`
– `1 <= Node.val <= 10^6`
– `1 <= k <= n`
