# 3289. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville

## Easy

In the town of `Digitville`, there was a list of numbers called `nums` containing integers from `0` to `n - 1`. Each
number was supposed to appear exactly once in the list, however, two mischievous numbers sneaked in an additional time,
making the list longer than usual. As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array
of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to `Digitville`.

### Constraints:

– `2 <= n <= 100`
– `nums.length == n + 2`
– `0 <= nums[i] < n`

- The input is generated such that `nums` contains exactly two repeated elements.
