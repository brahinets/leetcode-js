# 836. Rectangle Overlap

## Easy

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is **positive**. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles `rec1` and `rec2`, return `true` if they overlap, otherwise return `false`.

### Constraints:

- `rec1.length == 4`
- `rec2.length == 4`
- `-10^9 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 10^9`
- `rec1` and `rec2` represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.
