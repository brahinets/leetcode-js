# 1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits

## Easy

You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of 1's in their
binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending
order. Return the array after sorting it.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`
