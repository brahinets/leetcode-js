# 3516. Find Closest Person

## Easy

You are given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the positions of three people on a number line:

- `x` is the position of Person 1.
- `y` is the position of Person 2.
- `z` is the position of Person 3, who does not move.
  Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.

Determine which person reaches Person 3 first:

- Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
- Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
- Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.

Return the result accordingly.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= x, y, z <= 100`
