# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Medium

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other
uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times. Return the length of the longest
substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`
