# 846. Hand of Straights

## Medium

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size
`groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards. Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value
written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false`
otherwise.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= hand.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`

**Note:** This question is the same as [#1296](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/)
