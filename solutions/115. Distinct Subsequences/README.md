# 115. Distinct Subsequences

## Hard

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`. The test cases are
generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
