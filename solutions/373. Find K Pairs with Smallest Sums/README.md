# 373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums

## Medium

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in ascending order and an integer `k`. Define a
pair `(u, v)` which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array. Return the `k`
pairs `(u1, v1)`, `(u2, v2)`, ..., `(uk, vk)` with the smallest sums.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9`
- `nums1` and `nums2` both are sorted in ascending order.
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`
